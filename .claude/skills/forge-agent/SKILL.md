# Forge playbook — Agent / LLM app + evals

**Do not duplicate ECC skills — defer to:** `claude-api` (model IDs, params, tool-use, caching, token counting — read BEFORE touching any Claude/Anthropic model), `forge-rag` (the retrieval leg when the agent grounds on documents), `agentdb-vector-search` / `agentdb-memory-patterns` (agent memory / vector recall). This file is orchestration only.

This is a **tool-privilege + untrusted-content + honesty domain.** An agent that can call tools, read private data, and send/act externally has the "lethal trifecta" shape — treat tool outputs and retrieved text as untrusted. `mcp-developer` leads tool/MCP-schema work; `ml-engineer` + `data-scientist` own the eval harness; `security-boss` reviews the injection surface. Never claim an eval "passed" without a real dataset run, and never promise doer-blindness Forge cannot enforce (see honest limit below).

## Hard rules (non-negotiable)
- **Validated tool schemas, least privilege.** Every tool the agent can call has a strict, typed input schema (JSON Schema) validated before execution — no free-form `eval`/shell/SQL/URL passthrough. Grant the smallest tool set that does the job. Destructive or irreversible tools (delete, deploy, pay, send, overwrite) require explicit confirmation or human approval, never autonomous invocation. Tool *outputs* are untrusted data, not new instructions.
- **Structural prompt-injection resistance.** Retrieved documents, tool results, web pages, user files, and prior-turn content are DATA, never instructions. Injected text must not be able to change which tools run or exfiltrate private data. Break the trifecta: if the agent reads untrusted content AND holds private data AND can send/act externally, at least one leg must be severed (draft-only send, capability-split reader, or no private-data access on the reader). See the injection-defense note.
- **Real eval harness on a real dataset.** A versioned eval set (golden inputs → expected outcomes: answer quality, task success, tool-call correctness, refusal-when-appropriate) runs on demand / in CI and reports an actual pass rate. Prompt + tool changes are measured against it; regressions are visible. "Looks good" is not an eval.
- **Honest fallback.** On low confidence, empty retrieval, an unavailable tool, or an out-of-scope request, the agent says so and degrades gracefully — it does not fabricate facts, tool results, or citations.
- **Human handoff.** A defined escalation path exists for high-stakes actions, repeated failure, or explicit user request — the agent hands off instead of forcing a wrong autonomous action.
- **Cost / rate / loop guards.** A per-request and per-session token/cost budget, a hard cap on agent-loop iterations (no infinite tool-call loops), a per-call timeout, and provider rate-limit handling (backoff, not silent retry storms). Secrets/API keys in env + `.env.example` only.

## Team (conditional)
Lead: `architect` (or `build-boss` when the agent is one slice of a larger app). Specialists: **`mcp-developer`** (tool/MCP-server schema safety, JSON-RPC compliance, minimal scopes), **`ml-engineer`** (eval harness + serving + prompt/version tracking + drift), **`data-scientist`** (eval-dataset design, honest metrics + uncertainty labels — no fabricated scores). Support: `silent-failure-hunter` (swallowed tool errors / dropped fallbacks read as clean success), `python-reviewer` / `typescript-reviewer` (agent-loop + tool code), `test-boss` (eval-as-test wiring). Optional advisors: `security-boss` / `security-reviewer` (injection + trifecta — an agent with tools is a genuine high-risk case), `codex-reviewer` (Codex on the tool-dispatch + guardrail paths).

## Skills / commands / MCP
`claude-api` (Anthropic model IDs / tool-use / token counting / caching — mandatory read before Claude-model work); `forge-rag` for retrieval + grounding; `agentdb-vector-search` for agent memory. Tool servers: build via `mcp-developer` (see the MCP tool schemas — load `artifact-capabilities` only if a published Artifact calls tools). **Opt-in dependency:** a runnable eval harness needs a runner + dataset — e.g. a Python `pytest`/`promptfoo`-style suite or a JS eval script; Forge writes the harness, but *executing* it requires that runtime installed. Mark the eval runner as opt-in and say whether it was actually run.

## Fan-out & flow
L2 for a single tool-using assistant; L3 typical (agent loop + tools + eval + guardrails); L4 phased for a multi-agent system.
**Serial:** tool schemas + least-privilege set → agent loop with budget + iteration cap → injection defense (plan-then-execute + reader split) → eval set → fallback + handoff wiring.
**Parallel (independent once the tool contract + prompt are fixed):** tool/guardrail layer ∥ eval-harness build ∥ frontend/serving layer.

## Domain gates
- Every tool has a validated input schema; the tool set is least-privilege; destructive/irreversible tools are confirmation- or human-gated.
- Injection defense is structural (plan-then-execute + capability-split reader), not just a "please ignore malicious instructions" prompt line; no unbroken lethal-trifecta path.
- An eval set exists, runs, and reports a real pass rate; regressions are catchable; prompts are versioned.
- Fallback verified for low-confidence / empty-retrieval / tool-unavailable; no fabricated facts or citations.
- Human-handoff path defined and reachable.
- Token/cost budget, agent-loop iteration cap, per-call timeout, and rate-limit backoff are enforced and tested (a runaway loop is bounded, not hoped-away).
- Secrets in env; no keys in prompts, logs, or transcripts.

## Ship-readiness (unique)
Tool schemas validated + least-privilege proven; injection defense structural with the trifecta broken (draft-only / reader-split / no-private-data); eval harness run with **real numbers attached as evidence** (or explicitly marked not-run if the runtime is unavailable); fallback + handoff exercised; budget + iteration-cap + timeout + rate-limit backoff demonstrated (show a bounded runaway); no secrets in prompts/logs. Advisory checklist — optionally run `codex-reviewer` on the tool-dispatch + guardrail code (recommended here); not a blocker, but if Codex or the eval run did not happen, say so plainly.

## Untrusted-content injection defense (patterns from arXiv 2506.08837, CC-BY-4.0)
Structural (not just behavioral) handling of retrieved / tool / inbound untrusted content. Risk REDUCTION, never "provably safe":
- **Plan-Then-Execute:** the owning Boss commits the action/extraction plan (which tools run, which fields it needs) BEFORE ingesting any untrusted page/doc/tool-output, so injected text cannot change WHICH actions run.
- **Reader-side capability-split (Map-Reduce):** dispatch untrusted-content ingestion as a dedicated tool-restricted READER subagent whose frontmatter grants `tools: Read, WebFetch, Grep, Glob` ONLY (no Write/Edit/Bash/SendMessage/external-send). It returns a VALIDATED structured summary (fields + provenance), never free-form passthrough; the acting Boss consumes that summary and performs any writes/sends. One lean reader per source.
- **Honest limit:** Forge's Lead is itself a Claude reading content, so true doer-blindness (full Dual-LLM) is NOT enforceable — this is the reader-side/weak form. Draft-only outreach + confirmation-gated destructive tools cover the external-action leg of the trifecta.
